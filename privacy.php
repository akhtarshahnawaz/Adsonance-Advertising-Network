        <p>Welcome to the Adsonance  web site at  http://www.Adsonance.com (the "Site"). Adsonance is an online  advertising company and values the privacy of Internet visitors  ("Users") to the Site as well Users that visit web sites where our  advertising technology is enabled.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide Users  with information about what information we gather from Users, how we use  that information, what we do to protect that information, and your  choices regarding the collection and use of your data for   advertising purposes. We always welcome comments on our Privacy Policy  and constantly strive to maintain a Privacy Policy                 which improves the service we provide to advertisers,  publishers and Users in general.</p>
        <h4>About Our Online Advertising Services</h4>
        <p>Adsonance operates an online advertising network (the  "Technology") through which we work with hundreds of people around  the world buying display advertising space and reselling it in targeted  packages to advertisers and agencies. Users benefit from targeted  advertising as they receive advertisements that they are more likely to  be interested in, and advertisers benefit as advertising is more  efficiently delivered to interested Users.</p>
        <p>The targeting options are based on anonymous data that  is collected over time across social networks and may range from targeting a User's general  geographic location to targeting involving User's interests and  similarities between Users. This data may be used to identify and  predict the sites and groups of Users that are most likely to create a  response to an advertiser's campaign. </p>
        <h4>What Information We Collect</h4>
        <ul class="listingContent">
          <li><u>No Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</u>.  We do not collect any personally identifiable information using the                   Technology. The IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau),  which is a trade association for the Internet marketing industry,  defines personally identifiable information as "information that can be  traced back to a specific User and provide personal information such                   as name, address, phone number, etc." This includes  information about you that can identify you as a specific individual  rather than                   an anonymous profile. We do not collect sensitive  consumer information, such as insurance plan numbers, financial account  numbers, or information about medical conditions through the Technology.  All of our profiles are anonymous, and relate to a browser rather  identifying a specific individual. While we may be able to associate  interests and intent to purchase with specific profiles, we cannot match  that anonymous profile with specific individuals. </li>
          <li><u>Click Information</u>. We may receive information  when you click on or otherwise interact with ads deployed using the  Technology, including when you indicate a "like" or "share" for the ad  by clicking on a button near the ad. The information received by us may  include information about the ad that was clicked on, the web page, or  other session-based and request-based information as described above. We  may also receive information regarding any links that you may click on  that are associated with ads deployed using the Technology, or any links  that you share or receive from third parties related to those ads. </li>
          <li><u>Information Acquired from Other Sources</u>. We  may acquire anonymous data from third party sources, including through  websites that use our Technology. This data cannot be used to identify  specific individuals and may be used for a variety of purposes,  including to update existing User profiles, to provide our clients and  others with aggregate information about traffic and site usage in our  advertising network, and other uses as described below in the section  entitled, &ldquo;How We Use and Disclose Information.&rdquo; We do not share, rent  or sell any of the data acquired from third party sources, and require  these third party sources to be privacy-compliant in their use of  personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How We Use and Disclose Information</h4>
        <ul class="listingContent">
          <li><u>In General</u>. Adsonance uses the information  collected by the Technology to tailor advertising to you more  effectively. The aim is for you to see ads which you are more likely to  be interested in, rather than ads that you aren't. We do this by  comparing the information relating to the browser's anonymous profile,  against our selection of ad campaigns and choosing the most suitable  advertisement. In general, Adsonance can only create these profiles and  display ads to you when you visit a web site within our network. Many  web sites do not charge you for the services that they provide, but are  instead funded by the ads that you view, including providing anonymous,  non-personally identifiable information to advertisers. The more  effective the advertising on a web site, the more money the web site can  generate from fewer ads, which reduces the clutter and invasiveness of  the advertising on their web sites. Identifying anonymous profiles  allows Adsonance to offer an improved online experience for you,  increased performance to our advertisers and publishers, and enhanced  revenues for web sites within our ad network. </li>
          <li><u>Adsonance Technology</u>. Adsonance uses its   technology to help our clients deliver relevant online  advertisements. Technology behind Adsonance provides us with a method of connecting  people who have shared links, applications, or other content  with other parties. By using our Technology, our clients can  atrget audience with more personal appeal based on their characteristics, interests etc improving their ability to deliver more relevant advertising. </li>
          <li><u>Performance Attribution</u>. We monitor the  sales, signups or visits to certain predetermined pages on our  advertisers' web sites. We reconcile these page 'hits' back to the ads  that were shown to allow us to manage advertising campaign delivery, and  report on this to our advertisers and publishers. We use cookies to  limit the number of ads any individual computer is exposed to, also  known as frequency capping. </li>
          <li><u>Service Providers</u>. Adsonance works with  authorized service providers to provide website hosting, maintenance,  and other services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these  service providers to complete their obligations to us, these service  providers may have access to User information. However, we contractually  require these service providers to safeguard User information and  generally limit their use of User information to the purpose for which  it was shared. </li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Data Retention</h4>
        <p>Adsonance maintains all server log data and stored data  for a period of 3 months to comply with audits, court order or law  enforcement inquiries. After 3 months all of the stored data is  destroyed. Summarized data is kept indefinitely. Summarized data is  aggregated statistical data (impressions, clicks, and conversions) used  for financial reporting purposes.</p>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>Adsonance uses commercially reasonable physical,  managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and  security of User information. These include internal reviews of our data  collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as  well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access  to systems where we store data.</p>
