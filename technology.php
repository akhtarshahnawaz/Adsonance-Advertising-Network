        <h4>Resonatic Advertising Platform</h4>
        <p>Adsonance's platform is designed  with resonatic, realtime and AI based Logical, Mathematical and Analytical groups of program modules.</p>
        <p>What it means is that everytime an advertisement is created it is filtered with  our Adsonance Platform to find best possible ways to maximize audience's interaction with  advertisement. Whether it is mobile, Tablet, PC or any other means of internet communication our platform has reach over all these modes to deliver advertisements to audience on any platform anywhere.</p>
        <p>Advertisements created through adsonance are one way i.e. once they are created they keep resonating by shares and comments across web and whenever over the web someone re-shares your advertisement  your advertisement will become alive with new energy again which means that your advertisement will never be dead.</p>
        <p>Advertisers on Adsonance need to pay for only First-Party Impressions i.e. impressions their advertisements got from audience connected with first party or the publisher.</p>
